Hurricane Joaquin (Spanish pronunciation: [xwa'kin] wah-keen)[1] is an active extratropical cyclone over the northern Atlantic Ocean currently threatening the Iberian Peninsula. It severely impacted large parts of the Bahamas and recently affected Bermuda. It is the tenth named storm, third hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a non-tropical low, Joaquin was first classified a tropical depression on September 28, well southwest of Bermuda. With strong wind shear aloft the depression initially struggled to strengthen while moving slowly southwest. After becoming a tropical storm the next day, Joaquin underwent a phase of rapid intensification over warm sea temperatures with abating shear, reaching hurricane status on September 30 and major hurricane strength on October 1. Meandering over the southern Bahamas, Joaquin's eye passed close to or over several islands over the following two days. On October 3 the hurricane weakened somewhat and accelerated to the northeast. Abrupt re-intensification ensued later that day, and Joaquin acquired sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), constituting its peak strength. This made it the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Igor in 2010.

Hurricane warnings were raised across much of the Bahamas on September 30 as the hurricane threatened the country. Battering the nation's southern islands for over two days, Joaquin caused extensive devastation; Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Island, Rum Cay and San Salvador Island sustained the worst damage. Communities were left isolated and flooded for several days. Offshore the cargo ship El Faro went missing with 33 crew; after extensive searching the United States Coast Guard believes the vessel likely sank. Later the weakening hurricane passed just west of Bermuda, buffeting the island with strong winds that caused power cuts and minor damage.
On September 25, 2015, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) began monitoring an upper-level low, accompanied by a surface trough, several hundred miles south-southwest of Bermuda for possible tropical cyclogenesis.[2] The system gradually consolidated as it drifted north-northwest, acquiring a closed surface low late on September 26.[3] Convective activity—showers and thunderstorms—steadily increased on September 27, and at 03:00 UTC on September 28 the NHC assessed the system to have become a tropical depression, situated roughly 405 mi (650 km) southwest of Bermuda.[4][5][6] Although the depression featured a well-defined low, strong wind shear displaced convection and exposed the circulation. A ridge to the north was forecast to steer the system slowly northwest into a region of higher shear; meteorologists at the NHC initially depicted the system dissipating within 96 hours based on modeling depictions.[5] Convection developed and persisted closer to the circulation centre throughout September 28,[7] and early on September 29 Dvorak satellite classifications indicated the system to have become a tropical storm. It was assigned the name Joaquin accordingly, the tenth named storm of the season.[8][9]
Strengthening of the mid-level ridge prompted a sudden shift in Joaquin's trajectory to the southwest, directing it towards The Bahamas.[8][10] Forecasters at the NHC noted considerable uncertainty in the future of Joaquin, with forecast models depicting a wide range of possibilities.[11] Throughout September 29 the storm steadily intensified as its circulation became embedded within deep convection and upper-level outflow became increasingly prominent.[12] High sea surface temperatures and decreasing shear aided strengthening, and early on September 30 the storm achieved hurricane status.[13][14] Rapid intensification ensued thereafter with an eye developing within a symmetric central dense overcast. Data from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that Joaquin reached Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by 03:00 UTC on October 1.[15] Around 15:00 UTC the eye of Joaquin passed over Samana Cay, Bahamas, with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h).[16] Hours later the system further intensified to Category 4 status, attaining maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h), as its eye contracted from 41 to 27 mi (66 to 43 km) in diameter.[17][18] At this time Joaquin was located just 15 mi (25 km) northwest of Crooked Island.[19] The storm's central pressure bottomed out at 931 mbar (hPa; 27.49 inHg) around 00:00 UTC on October 2.[20]

As the ridge previously steering Joaquin southwest began retreating north, the hurricane's movement slowed and shifted west, and later north, early on October 2.[21][22] An eyewall replacement cycle—a process whereby a second, larger eye develops while the inner eye collapses—began that morning;[23] its eye became increasingly ill defined in satellite imagery.[22] Slight weakening took place accordingly,[24] and the hurricane passed over Rum Cay and San Salvador Island around 18:00 UTC and 21:00 UTC as a low-end Category 4 and high-end Category 3 respectively;[25] a pressure near 944 mbar (hPa; 27.88 inHg) was observed on San Salvador Island.[26] An amplifying trough over the Southeastern United States enhanced southwesterly flow over Joaquin on October 3 and prompted the hurricane to accelerate northeast away from the Bahamas.[27] Throughout the day the storm's eye became increasingly defined and re-intensification ensued.[28] Aircraft reconnaissance found a considerably stronger system that afternoon; based on flight-level winds of 166 mph (267 km/h), it is estimated that Joaquin attained surface winds of 155 mph (250 km/h)—a high-end Category 4 hurricane—by 16:00 UTC.[29]

Shortly after peaking, the hurricane's overall structure began to deteriorate, signalling a weakening trend.[30] On October 4 the storm curved towards the north-northeast between a large low pressure system to its west and a mid-level ridge to its east.[31] As deep convection over its core continued to wane,[32] Joaquin passed about 65 mi (105 km) west-northwest of Bermuda near 00:00 UTC on October 5, at Category 2 intensity.[33] The final advisory issued for Joaquin was the morning of October 8 when it had become a post-tropical cyclone.[34]
Tropical cyclone watches and warnings were posted throughout the Bahamas starting early on September 30 (UTC);[35] by October 1, hurricane warnings extended from Grand Bahama Island in the northwest to Mayaguana in the southeast.[36] As the storm moved away, the last advisories were discontinued by the morning of October 3.[37] All schools on Exuma, Cat Island, San Salvador, and Rum Cay closed on the afternoon of October 1 until further notice.[38] Bahamasair cancelled multiple domestic flights,[39] and most airports throughout the island nation were closed, pending post-storm runway inspections.[40] Residents on Mayaguana were advised to evacuate.[41] The nation's National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) activated its Emergency Operations Center.[42] As conditions worsened, residents in southern islands of the Bahamas criticized the government for providing inadequate warning, with no emergency preparations taking place on Acklins. NEMA refuted the claim and stated people were given ample warning but many residents refused to evacuate. In some instances, police were called in to forcibly move people to shelters.[43]

In the Turks and Caicos Islands to the southeast of the Bahamas, the storm forced the closure of schools and government offices.[44] Two cruise ships were redirected from the island, and Providenciales International Airport suspended operations for a time.[45] The islands were placed under a tropical storm warning on October 1.[36] On October 2 (UTC), tropical storm warnings were hoisted along coastal Camagüey, Las Tunas, Holguín, and Guantánamo provinces in Cuba.[46]

On September 30, Virginian governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency for the entire state owing to heavy rains, unrelated to the hurricane, and the threat of Joaquin.[47] The City of Norfolk also declared an emergency.[48] Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy advised residents to be prepared for potential impacts from the hurricane,[49] as did Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York.[50] On October 1, Governors Larry Hogan, Chris Christie, Pat McCrory, and Nikki Haley declared a state of emergency for Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, and South Carolina respectively.[51] Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, was placed under a mandatory evacuation at 3:00 p.m. EDT (19:00 UTC).[52] In New Jersey, the state of emergency caused the annual Bike MS: City to Shore Ride to be canceled for the first time in its 35-year history.[53]

On the afternoon of October 2, a tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda,[54] and a hurricane warning was in effect late on October 3.[55] As a precaution, Royal Bermuda Regiment soldiers were placed on standby, and some emergency equipment was stationed on the east end of the Causeway to prepare for the possibility of the road becoming impassable;[56] officials ultimately closed the Causeway late on October 4, near the height of the storm, and partially reopened it the next morning.[57][58] By October 3, two cruise ships had canceled their scheduled stops to Bermuda.[59] Most commercial flights to and from the island on October 4 were canceled, and L.F. Wade International Airport suspended all operations that afternoon. Public and private schools were scheduled to close on October 5, though one institution was prepared for use as an emergency shelter. The approaching hurricane halted ferry and bus services.[60]
Large swells ahead of the storm's arrival in the Bahamas washed out a main road on San Salvador Island.[41] Widespread power outages affected several islands as the hurricane closed in.[61] Reports of flooding and people in need of assistance were received from Acklins, Crooked Island, Exuma, and Long Island.[42] Power and communication failures plagued the nation's southeastern islands, leaving Acklins, Crooked Island, and Long Island effectively isolated in the immediate aftermath of Joaquin.[62] Early aerial surveys revealed that Acklins, Rum Cay, Crooked Island, and San Salvador Island were "completely devastated".[63] Eight to ten people were stranded on Samana Cay, which received the full brunt of Joaquin's impact.[43] Throughout the archipelago, flooding from the hurricane trapped over 500 residents as of October 8.[64]

Powerful winds brought down trees and utility poles on Rum Cay, clogging roadways.[65] A number of homes were damaged or destroyed in the district; two grocery stores and a municipal dock also sustained damage. A church housing 32 evacuees became flooded and structurally compromised, forcing the inhabitants to relocate.[66] Acklins endured severe flooding, with many homes inundated and numerous calls for rescue; the island's sea barrier was breached by 9:00 a.m. local time. Some residents reported the entire island to be under water.[43] The storm demolished about 20 residences on Acklins, and a bridge in Lovely Bay was completely destroyed.[67] Floodwaters up to 5 ft (1.5 m) deep submerged at least 70% of nearby Crooked Island, where the storm left widespread structural damage.[67] Forty-six displaced Crooked Island residents, some requiring medical attention, were transported by air to New Providence on
