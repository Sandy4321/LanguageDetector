On 30 September 2015, Russia started a military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.[59] It consisted of air strikes by Russia against militant groups opposed to Syrian government, primarily al-Nusra Front and Jaysh al-Fatah (the Army of Conquest).[60][61][62] Russian army had significant ground support from Iranian ground troops, the Syrian military, and allied militias.[63] Prior to the intervention, Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War had mainly consisted of arming the Syrian Army.[64] Russia intervened after a formal request from the Syrian government for military help against rebel and jihadist groups in Syria.[65] Most Russia's airstrikes during the first week of the campaign struck areas held by rebel groups opposed to both the Syrian government and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.[66][67][68][69][70][71]

The United States, which opposes both the aState and the Syrian government, has ruled out military cooperation with Russia in Syria.[72] Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and other senior U.S. officials said Russia's campaign was primarily aimed at propping up Assad, whom President Barack Obama has repeatedly called upon to leave power,[67] an assessment shared by France.[69] The U.S. has been leading a separate campaign in Syria since September 2014, as well as one in Iraq since June 2014, both aimed solely against the Islamic State and al Qaeda affiliates.
The Syrian Civil War is being waged between multiple opposition and government groups and their local and foreign support bases, who share a shifting, complex web of inter-relationships. As several months of air strikes conducted by the US-led coalition ostensibly against ISIL targets appeared to have resulted in further expansion and strengthening of the ISIL,[73] Russia, an ally of Syria, in September 2015 started sending its own Russian-operated warplanes and other military hardware, as well as combat troops, to an airbase near the port city of Latakia in Syria.[74] The action was undertaken at an official request by the Syrian government headed by President Bashar al-Assad.[75]

At the end of September 2015, a joint information centre in Baghdad was set up by Iran, Iraq, Russia and Syria to coordinate their operations against Islamic State.[76]

On 30 September 2015, the upper house of the Russian Federal Assembly, the Federation Council, granted the request by Russian President Vladimir Putin to deploy the Russian Air Force in Syria.[77] On the same day, the Russian representative to the joint information centre arrived at the US Embassy in Baghdad and requested that any U.S. forces in the targeted area in Syria leave immediately.[78] An hour later, the Russian aircraft based in the government-held territory began conducting airstrikes ostensibly against the Islamic State targets.[79]
The first series of air strikes took place on 30 September 2015 in areas around the cities of Homs and Hama, targeting the mainstream opposition.[59] Russian warplanes attacked rebel positions "in al-Rastan, Talbiseh and Zafaraniya in Homs province; Al-Tilol al-Hmer in Quneitra province; Aydoun, a village on the outskirts of the town of Salamiya; Deer Foul, between Hama and Homs; and the outskirts of Salmiya".[80] In total, 20 flights were made.[81] Most of the initial airstrikes targeted positions of the Chechen fighters, Islamic Front's Jaysh al-Islam (Army of Islam),[82] and Free Syrian Army.[83][84][85]

According to Hezbollah media outlet Al Mayadeen, the Saudi/Turkish-backed Army of Conquest[7] around Jisr ash-Shugour was bombed on 1 October by Russian planes; at least 30 air strikes were carried out.[14] Another series of Russian airstrikes carried out that same day hit ISIL positions in Raqqa governorate.[3]

On 2 October, head of the foreign-affairs committee in the Russian parliament, Aleksey Pushkov, said that the Russian airstrikes could go on for three to four months and would intensify;[86] he later said that this was a mere surmise of his and he was not privy to any knowledge on the issue.[87] In the morning, the Russian Air Force launched four airstrikes on ISIS in the ancient Syriac city of Al-Qaryatayn, and the Teefor-Palmyra highway, Homs province.[22] An ISIS command and control center was destroyed in a single airstrike in Al-Qaryatayn, while an ISIS convoy on their way to the Teefor-Palmyra highway was attacked.[22] Following the airstrikes, the Syrian Army and National Defence Forces pushed ISIS out of the town of Maheen towards Al-Qaryatayn after a two hour engagement that killed 18 militants and destroyed two technicals mounted with ZU-23-2s.[22] Syrian forces then launched a counter-attack south-west of Al-Qaryatayn to recover the main road.[22]

In the same day, the Russian Air Force began bombing Al-Nusra Front[88] positions in al-Rastan and Talbiseh in the Homs province.[12] Later, they proceeded with bombing Al-Nusra in Kafr Zita, Al-Ghaab Plains, Kafr Nabl, Kafr Sijnah, and Al-Rakaya in the Hama province.[12] The Syrian Air Force and the Russian Air Force jointly bombed Al-Nusra in Jisr al-Shughur.[12] At night, the Russian Air Force targeted ISIS with 11 airstrikes over Al-Raqqah while targeting electrical grids outside it, two airstrikes over Shadadi-Hasakah highway, and three airstrikes in Al-Mayadeen, Deir ez-Zor province.[12] The primary ISIS military base in Tabaqa Military Airport was also attacked, with the barracks being destroyed in two airstrikes. Near the Military Airport, an ISIS weapons supply depot in Al-‘Ajrawi Farms was also bombed. At the same time, the ISIS primary headquarters in Tabaqa National Hospital was heavily damaged in a Russian airstrike.[12][13] In Al-Hasakah province, the Russian Air Force targeted ISIS in Al-Shadadi and Al-Houl, while the Syrian Air Force attacked an ISIS convoy along the Deir ez-Zor-Hasakah highway.[13]

On 3 October, reports indicated that Hezbollah and Iranian fighters were preparing major ground offensives to be coordinated with Russian airstrikes.[89] According to CNN, the Russian defense ministry said its soldiers bombed nine ISIS positions near the terror group's de facto capital in Raqqa. At least 11 were killed in an alleged double strike by Russia in Syria's Idlib province, according to opposition groups.[90] During the day, the Russian Air Force made four airstrikes over Al-Nusra controlled Jisr al-Shughur, and additional ones in Jabal Al-Zawiya, and Jabal al-Akrad.[91] One of the targets was an Al-Nusra reinforcement convoy heading from Jisr al-Shughur to the northeast countryside of Latakia province.[91]

On the morning of 7 October 2015, according to the Russian officials, four warships from the Russian Navy's Caspian Flotilla launched 26 3M-14T Kalibr NK[92] cruise missiles that hit 11 targets within Syrian territory. The missiles passed through Iranian and Iraqi airspace in order to reach their targets at a distance of well over about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles).[93] The same day, Syrian ground forces were reported to carry out an offensive under Russian air cover.[94][95] According to unnamed U.S. military and intelligence officials, 4 of 26 cruise missiles on 8 October crashed in Iran, well before reaching their targets in Syria. Russia claimed all of its missiles hit their targets.[96][97]Iran also denied any missile crash on its territory.[98] [99]Iranian defence ministry rejected any reports alleging that four of the 26 cruise missiles crashed in Iran saying the CNN reports are part of the West's "psychological warfare".[100]

The Russian defense ministry announced on 9 October that up to sixty ISIL targets were hit in the past 24 hours, supposedly killing 300 militants in the most intense strikes so far. One of the raids targeted a Liwa al-Haqq base in the Al-Raqqah Governorate using KAB-500KR precision-guided bombs, in which two senior ISIL commanders and up to 200 militants were killed, despite the lack of connection between Liwa al-Haqq and ISIL. Another assault destroyed a former prison near Aleppo that was used by ISIL as a base and munitions depot, also killing scores of militants. Rebel training sites in the Latakia and Idlib provinces were allegedly hit as well.[101] Meanwhile, ISIL militants made advances in the Aleppo area on 9 October, seizing several villages, including Tal Qrah, Tal Sousin, and Kfar Qares, in what the Associated Press called a "lightning attack". The attacks were unencumbered by either Russian or U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. The ISIL advance came at the expense of rebel groups also targeted by Russian and Syrian forces.[102]
The Quds Force under General Qasem Soleimani has been involved in support of the Assad government since the very beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. This support has taken many forms, chief among them military support in terms of training, logistics, deployments of allied militias to Syria (particularly Shi'ite militias), operational and strategic planning, intelligence-sharing and weaponry. Iran is estimated to be providing the equivalent of many billions of dollars in financial aid.[41] Key victories were achieved with substantial support provided by the Quds force, namely the al-Ghab plains battles, Aleppo offensives, Dara'aya offensives of 2015 and the al-Qusayr offensives which established government and Hezbollah control over the northern Qalamoun region and the border crossings from Lebanon to Syria.

After the loss of Idlib province to a rebel offensive in the first half of 2015, the situation was judged to have become critical for Assad's survival. High level talks were initiated between Moscow and Iran which continue to this day which involved the Russian and Iranian foreign ministers, concerning possible solutions to the Syrian conflicts. On 24 July, ten days after the signing of the nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1 countries, General Qasem Soleimani visited Moscow.[103] Though the exact content of the meeting between Soleimani and Putin is widely speculated about, there is growing consensus that the chief matter at hand was a plan of coordinated escalation of military forces in Syria.[104]

In mid-September 2015, the first reports of new detachments from the Iranian revolutionary guards arriving in Tartous and Latakia in west Syria were made. With much of the SAA and NDF units deployed to more volatile fronts, the Russian Marines and Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRG) have relieved their positions by installing military checkpoints inside the cities of Slunfeh (east Latakia Governorate), Masyaf (east Tartous Governorate) and Ras Al-Bassit (Latakia coastal city).[105] There were also further reports of new Iranian contingents being deployed to Syria in early October 2015.[106] It is generally thought that Iran will be playing a leading role in the ground operations of Syria's army and allies, whilst Russia will be leading in the air in conjunction with the Syrian air force, thereby establishing a complementary role.[15]

Outside of the battlefield itself the Iranian government has dramatically increased its efforts in supporting the Syrian government and its military. Recently there has been an exponential increase in recruitment efforts aimed at drawing on Shi'ite militias in Iraq in order to deploy them to Syria.[23] One of the leading militias in Iran's efforts to bolster the war effort in Syria is Kata'ib al-Imam Ali, with Jaafar al-Bindawi, the militia's former head of training and logistics, would be leading the deployment in Syria, while Ali Nizam would serve as the new logistical director for Syrian affairs. Another important allied militia in this context is Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba which similar to Kata'ib al-Imam Ali was formed with Iranian assistance from mainly former Sadrist supporters and fighters. There is increasing evidence that these Iranian-backed militias are not only operating under Iranian guidance but are also cooperating with the Russian military command established in Syria.[23]

On 8 October reports came in of the death of General Hamadani, the deputy to General Qasem Soleimani in Syria. Initially it was claimed that he fell to gun-fire from ISIL militants in northern Aleppo whilst advising the troop build-up on that front.[107] However it later transpired that the cause of his death was an auto-mobile accident.[2] It is thought that his death will significantly delay the ground-operations in northern Syria as Hamadani was the primary strategist in the planning of the coming operations.[2]
Syria: The Syrian ambassador to Moscow, Riyad Haddad stated that the Russian air force is acting in full coordination with the Syrian army. He added that Syria's position is that the Russian intervention is the only legitimate intervention under international law, and called for other countries to join what he termed the "non-criminal" Russian-led intervention in Syria.[75]

International[edit]
U.S.-led coalition:

In a joint statement issued on 1 October 2015, participants in the U.S.-led anti-ISIL coalition called on Russia to curtail its air campaign in Syria, saying the airstrikes had hit Syrian opposition groups and civilians. Such strikes would "only fuel more extremism", the statement issued by the U.S., UK, Turkey and other coalition members declared.[108] "We call on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its attacks on the Syrian opposition and civilians and to focus its efforts on fighting ISIL."[109] U.S. President Barack Obama, at a news conference on October 2, underscored the coalition statement by saying the Russian action was driving moderate opposition groups underground, and would result in "only strengthening" IS.[110]

U.S.: In early October 2015, U.S. president Barack Obama was reported to have authorized the resupply of Syrian Kurds and the Arab-Syrian opposition, emphasizing to his team that the U.S. would continue to support the Syrian opposition now that Russia had joined the conflict.[111] On 8 October 2015, U.S. defence minister Carter, talking at a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels, said he believed Russia would soon start paying the price for its military intervention in Syria in the form of reprisal attacks and casualties;[112] he added he expected that "in the next few days the Russians will begin to lose in Syria".[113]
NATO has condemned Russian air strikes,[114] urged Russia to stop backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and on 8 October 2015 renewed assurances to defend the allies in view of the "escalation of Russian military activities" in Syria.[115]
Saudi Arabia: On 1 October 2015, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia had demanded that Russia cease its intervention, repeating claims made by Western diplomats that Russia was targeting the moderate anti-government opposition rather than "ISIS".[116]

Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after a series of alleged violations of the country's airspace by Russian military aircraft in early October 2015, warned that Russia’s military operation in Syria could jeopardise the bilateral ties between the countries.[117]
The Russian Federation: On 27 September 2015, President Vladimir Putin told journalist Charlie Rose that "More than 2,000 fighters from Russia and ex-Soviet republics are in the territory of Syria. There is a threat of their return to us. So, instead of waiting for their return, we are better-off fighting them on Syrian territory".[118] On 30 September 2015, the Russian Orthodox Church spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin, talking about the support of the government's action on the part of all the religious groups in Russia, said the fight against terrorism was a "moral fight, a holy fight if you will".[119][120] Leader of the Central Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Russia, Chief Mufti Talgat Tadzhuddin stated: "We fully back the use of a contingent of Russian armed forces in the battle against international terrorism."[121]

On 1 October 2015, President Vladimir Putin dismissed reports of alleged casualties among civilians caused by Russian airstrikes in Syria as "information warfare" against Russia, adding that these claims had begun before the planes used in the airstrikes had even taken off.[122] The Russian Defence Ministry made a claim that satellite images confirm that some air strikes hit alleged ISIS positions.[123]

Iran: Iran was confirmed as having hundreds of troops in Syria ready for combat against ISIS.[124]

Iraq: In early October 2015, the top officials of Iraq indicated that they would welcome Russian air strikes on Islamic State militants in Iraq and wanted Russia to have a bigger role than the U.S. in the war against the militant group.[125]
Egypt: On 3 October 2015, Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said the Russian entry into war in Syria was bound "to have an effect on limiting terrorism in Syria and eradicating it".[126]

China: China denied sending warships and troops to Syria after rumors about it were circulated around the internet.[127]

Israel: Israel was given advance warning of the airstrikes and has set up a working group to "coordinate on everything" with the Russians.[128] They were particularly concerned about ensuring the de facto alliance between Hezbollah and Russia won't lead to any unfortunate incidents.[129] According to Zvi Magen, former Israeli ambassador to Moscow, “Israel made clear to him [Putin] that we have no real problem with Assad, just with Iran and Hizbullah, and that message was understood.”[130]
